"""pyudev.glib
    ===========

    Glib integration.

    :class:`MonitorObserver` integrates device monitoring into the Glib
    mainloop by turing device events into Glib signals.

    :mod:`glib` and :mod:`gobject` from PyGObject_ must be available when
    importing this module. PyGtk is not required.
